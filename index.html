    <h1>B-Lo</h1>
    <div>My name is Brandon Lofele and I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through Framingham State University. I have spent the majority of my school and worklife committed to serving the communities I have had the privilege to be apart of by serving with AmeriCorps and a few Nonprofits. I am now embarking on an adventure to build websites and applications while I delve deeper into the world of Information Technology. I am excited to find ways to serve my community through the IT world. </div>
